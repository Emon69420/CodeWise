# Contributing guidelines

Weâ€™d love you to help us improve this project. To help us keep this collection
high quality, we request that contributions adhere to the following guidelines.

- **Provide a link to the application or projectâ€™s homepage**. Unless itâ€™s
  extremely popular, thereâ€™s a chance the maintainers donâ€™t know about or use
  the language, framework, editor, app, or project your change applies to.

- **Provide links to documentation** supporting the change youâ€™re making.
  Current, canonical documentation mentioning the files being ignored is best.
  If documentation isnâ€™t available to support your change, do the best you can
  to explain what the files being ignored are for.

- **Explain why youâ€™re making a change**. Even if it seems self-evident, please
  take a sentence or two to tell us why your change or addition should happen.
  Itâ€™s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to *everyone*
  who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.

- **Please consider the scope of your change**. If your change specific to a
  certain language or framework, then make sure the change is made to the
  template for that language or framework, rather than to the template for an
  editor, tool, or operating system.

- **Please only modify *one template* per pull request**. This helps keep pull
  requests and feedback focused on a specific project or technology.

In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change youâ€™re making,
the more likely weâ€™ll be to accept your contribution quickly.

If a template is mostly a list of files installed by a particular version of
some software (e.g. a PHP framework) then it's brittle and probably no more
helpful than a simple `ls`. If it's not possible to curate a small set of
useful rules, then the template might not be a good fit for this collection.

Please also understand that we canâ€™t list every tool that ever existed.
Our aim is to curate a collection of the *most common and helpful* templates,
not to make sure we cover every project possible. If we choose not to
include your language, tool, or project, itâ€™s not because itâ€™s not awesome.
