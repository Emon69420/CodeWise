# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gitingest Integration enhances the existing AI Project Analyzer by replacing the complex GitHub API streaming approach with gitingest, a Python tool that converts Git repositories into LLM-optimized text format. This integration will simplify repository ingestion, improve parsing accuracy, and provide better context for AI analysis while maintaining all existing security and functionality requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use gitingest to efficiently convert any Git repository into a structured text format, so that AI analysis becomes faster and more comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a repository URL THEN the system SHALL use gitingest to convert the repository into structured text format
2. WHEN gitingest processes a repository THEN the system SHALL capture the complete codebase structure including file paths, content, and metadata
3. WHEN ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL have a single text representation optimized for LLM consumption
4. WHEN processing large repositories THEN the system SHALL handle gitingest output efficiently without memory overflow
5. IF gitingest fails to process a repository THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want gitingest integration to preserve all file types and relationships, so that AI analysis covers the complete project ecosystem including documentation, configuration, and code files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gitingest processes a repository THEN the system SHALL include all relevant file types (code, docs, configs, tests)
2. WHEN analyzing the gitingest output THEN the system SHALL maintain file hierarchy and relationship information
3. WHEN creating the RAG knowledge base THEN the system SHALL use gitingest's structured format for better context chunking
4. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL reference specific files and line numbers from the gitingest output
5. WHEN filtering files THEN the system SHALL respect gitignore rules and exclude binary/irrelevant files automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want gitingest integration to work with both public and private repositories while maintaining the same security standards, so that sensitive code remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing private repositories THEN the system SHALL pass authentication credentials securely to gitingest
2. WHEN gitingest accesses repositories THEN the system SHALL ensure credentials are handled only in memory
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL clear all temporary files and authentication data
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose repository content or credentials in logs
5. IF gitingest creates temporary files THEN the system SHALL clean them up immediately after processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want gitingest integration to be faster than the current GitHub API approach, so that I can analyze repositories more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing to GitHub API streaming THEN gitingest integration SHALL complete repository ingestion faster
2. WHEN processing repositories THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for gitingest operations
3. WHEN gitingest runs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates to users
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL transition seamlessly to AI processing and visualization
5. IF gitingest takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the gitingest integration to enhance the existing flowchart and AI chat features, so that I get better insights from the improved repository representation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gitingest output is processed THEN the system SHALL generate more accurate dependency graphs for flowcharts
2. WHEN AI answers questions THEN the system SHALL leverage gitingest's structured format for better context retrieval
3. WHEN displaying code references THEN the system SHALL use gitingest's file path information for precise navigation
4. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL benefit from gitingest's comprehensive file inclusion
5. WHEN updating repositories THEN the system SHALL re-run gitingest to maintain current analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want gitingest integration to be configurable and maintainable, so that the system can adapt to different repository types and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the system THEN gitingest SHALL be included as a Python dependency with proper version management
2. WHEN configuring gitingest THEN the system SHALL allow customization of file inclusion/exclusion patterns
3. WHEN running gitingest THEN the system SHALL handle different Git authentication methods (HTTPS, SSH, tokens)
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting
5. IF gitingest updates are available THEN the system SHALL support easy upgrades without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want gitingest integration to work seamlessly with the existing web interface, so that the improved backend processing is transparent to my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the repository input interface THEN the system SHALL show gitingest processing status alongside existing progress indicators
2. WHEN gitingest completes THEN the system SHALL automatically proceed to AI processing and flowchart generation
3. WHEN errors occur during gitingest processing THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN switching between repositories THEN the system SHALL manage gitingest operations efficiently
5. IF gitingest processing is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow users to retry or cancel operations gracefully
