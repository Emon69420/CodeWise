# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a beautiful, dark-mode Streamlit frontend for the AI Project Analyzer Flask backend. The frontend will provide an intuitive interface for users to view their existing repositories and add new ones by providing GitHub repository URLs. The interface will communicate with the Flask backend to clone repositories and display analysis results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of my existing repositories in a clean, organized interface, so that I can quickly browse and select repositories I've already analyzed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display all repositories from the my_repos directory
2. WHEN repositories are displayed THEN the system SHALL show repository name, description, and last modified date
3. WHEN no repositories exist THEN the system SHALL display a friendly message indicating no repositories are available
4. WHEN repositories are listed THEN the system SHALL use a dark theme with good contrast and readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a GitHub repository URL and have it cloned automatically, so that I can analyze new repositories without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a valid GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format
2. WHEN I submit a repository URL THEN the system SHALL call the Flask backend to clone the repository
3. WHEN cloning is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and refresh the repository list
4. WHEN cloning fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
5. WHEN cloning is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to have a beautiful dark mode design, so that I can work comfortably in low-light environments and have a modern user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use a dark color scheme as the default theme
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use high contrast colors for good readability
3. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback on hover and click
4. WHEN displaying status messages THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors (green for success, red for errors, blue for info)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback on repository operations, so that I understand what's happening and can track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository operation starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL show success/failure notifications
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the repository list changes THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and intuitive, so that I can efficiently manage my repositories regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
2. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels and validation feedback
3. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and behavior
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts where appropriate
