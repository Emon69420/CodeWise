# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Project Analyzer is a web application that enables developers to analyze GitHub repositories using AI-powered insights. The system ingests public or private repositories, creates a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base, and provides both visual flowcharts and conversational AI interfaces for exploring codebases. The application integrates with GPT OSS via Hugging Face to deliver semantic search capabilities and intelligent code analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input a GitHub repository URL and have the system analyze the entire codebase, so that I can understand the project structure and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a public GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL clone and parse the repository content
2. WHEN a user provides a private GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL prompt for authentication credentials (token or SSH key)
3. WHEN repository ingestion begins THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators showing parsing status
4. WHEN ingestion completes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful analysis and display available features
5. IF a repository URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested corrections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to ask natural language questions about my repository and receive AI-generated answers, so that I can quickly understand code functionality and architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository has been analyzed THEN the system SHALL create a RAG knowledge base from all code files and documentation
2. WHEN a user submits a natural language question THEN the system SHALL use GPT OSS via Hugging Face to generate contextual answers
3. WHEN answering questions THEN the system SHALL reference specific files, functions, or code sections in the response
4. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL indicate the limitation and suggest alternative queries
5. WHEN multiple relevant code sections exist THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive answers referencing all applicable parts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to securely analyze private repositories without exposing sensitive credentials, so that I can maintain security while gaining insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling private repositories THEN the system SHALL accept GitHub personal access tokens through secure input fields
2. WHEN credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL store them only in memory or secure environment variables
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data from memory
4. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL display authentication errors without exposing credential details
5. IF SSH key authentication is used THEN the system SHALL support standard SSH key formats and secure key handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new contributor, I want to see an interactive visual flowchart of the repository structure, so that I can understand how files and components relate to each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate an interactive flowchart showing file and module relationships
2. WHEN a user clicks on a flowchart node THEN the system SHALL display the corresponding source code or file content
3. WHEN hovering over nodes THEN the system SHALL show AI-generated summaries of the component's purpose
4. WHEN the flowchart is complex THEN the system SHALL provide zoom, pan, and filtering capabilities
5. WHEN displaying relationships THEN the system SHALL show imports, dependencies, function calls, and class inheritance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis to stay current with repository changes, so that the insights remain accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests re-analysis THEN the system SHALL update the RAG knowledge base with current repository state
2. WHEN repository changes are detected THEN the system SHALL offer automatic re-analysis options
3. WHEN re-analysis occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve user session data and preferences
4. WHEN updates complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the flowchart and knowledge base automatically
5. IF webhook integration is configured THEN the system SHALL trigger re-analysis on repository push events

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean web interface to interact with both the AI chat and visual flowchart, so that I can efficiently explore repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive web interface compatible with modern browsers
2. WHEN using the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display conversation history and allow follow-up questions
3. WHEN viewing flowcharts THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation controls and clear visual hierarchy
4. WHEN switching between features THEN the system SHALL maintain context and allow seamless transitions
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface for touch interaction and smaller screens

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all sensitive data handled according to industry standards, so that my credentials and code remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all credential transmission
2. WHEN storing temporary data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information at rest
3. WHEN processing private repositories THEN the system SHALL not log or persist repository content unnecessarily
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages or logs
5. WHEN sessions end THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication tokens and temporary repository data
